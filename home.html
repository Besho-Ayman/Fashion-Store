        <h4 class="h4_home">
            The beginning was in 1909, when Fashion Store began sewing hats on 
            the ground floor of the “Balsan”  building in Paris to start what
            later became one of the largest fashion companies in the world.
            During this time, Fashion Store was associated with the “Archerboy
            Cable” And he is a member of a group of men in the tongue who
            helped her to obtain a headquarters for her at 31 Camillon Street in 
            Paris in 1910 and provided her with money.This man’s house was also a 
            place for treating men and women, which gave Fashion Store the opportunity 
            to sell her products of decorative hats to 
            <br>women in his home and Get to know them
        </h4>
        <h2 class="h3_home_bold">1901</h2>
        <h4 class="h4_home">He funded her first independent hat store, Chanel Styles (Chanel Mods),
                at 21 rue Cambon in Paris. Since this place already housed a fashion store, the commercial
                lease required Chanel to only sell hats, not high fashion.
                Two years later, in 1913, the high-end fashion 
                boutiques Deauville and Biarritz offered for sale a prêt-à-porter women's sportswear designed
                by Coco Chanel,whose practical designs allowed the wearer to exercise
                She hated women's fashions from those visiting these resorts.
                Chanel designs tended to be simple rather than complex
